    <p id="resullt"> The code loops through the string looking for "World War II." Line 2 progresses through
        the string character-by-character, examining each 12-character sequence. If it finds "World
        War II," line 3 concatenates three segments: all the characters preceding "World War II," the
        substitute phrase "the Second World War," and then all the characters following "World War
        II."</p>
